<p class="name">Your Company Name</p>
<h1>Your Main Header</h1>
<h4>Your Tagline or Business Slogan</h4>
```
- Update the `href` attributes in anchor tags (`<a>`) to point to your company's social media pages or sections of your website.

**Customize the Styling:**
- Open `style.css` to change the color scheme, fonts, or any other CSS properties you wish to personalize.
  
```css
:root {
  --background-1: #yourColor; /* Update colors as needed */
  --accent-1: #yourAccentColor; /* Accent colors for buttons and links */
}
```
- Customize the layout and responsive design by modifying existing classes or adding new ones.

**Adding JavaScript:**
